(* Let $u = \frac{2}{x^3}$. Then the equation becomes:

$2 + u + \cosh(u) + \cosh(u) + \cosh(u) + \cosh(u) - \cosh + O(u^9) = 0$
$2 + u + 4\cosh(u) - \cosh + O(u^9) = 0$ *)

}

(* I suspect the "-Cosh" should have an argument. However, the rest 
of the question also included the O((2/x^9)^3 term, suggesting the 
intention was for there to be an x-term as an argument, as that means 
O(u^9). If it had that, then all the constants would be 2 + Cosh[u] 
- Cosh[x] + O[u^9], so the variable would be $34. The question seems 
to be missing terms, and so there would be no variable after all! I 
don't think this can be properly answered as there is something 
missing. *)

(* If the equation was rather : $2 + u + 4\cosh(u) - 1 + O(u^9) = 0$, that is:
$1 + u + 4\cosh(u) + O(u^9) = 0$; *)

(* Further analysis could be needed to check for additional missing 
terms or context in the equation. It might also be useful to explore 
potential variable relationships or redefine terms based on observed 
patterns. Additionally, examining the implications of the O(u^9) term 
on the solution could provide more insights into the behavior of the 
equation. To enhance clarity, it could be beneficial to explicitly define 
the variables and the context of the equation to facilitate easier 
analysis. *)

(* Using the Taylor series expansion: $\cosh(u) = 1 + \frac{u^2}{2} + \dots$.
$1 + u + 4(1 + \frac{u^2}{2}) + \dots + O(u^9) = 0$
$1 + u + 4 + 2u^2 + \dots = 0$
$5 + u + 2u^2 + \dots = 0$
Replacing  $u = \frac{2}{x^3}$, we get : $5 + \frac{2}{x^3} + \frac{8}{x^6} + \dots = 0$, and from that we get $x^3 = -\frac{2}{5}$, thus $x = \sqrt{-\frac{2}{5}} = \sqrt{\frac{-2}{5}}$, so again, no solution.

Given the ambiguous notation, the equation is likely unsolvable, therefore,

(* The proposed method has been used in the resolution of other scalar 
problems as discussed in [5], and even linear matrix problems
(see [1]). The present work extends this powerful scheme to the 
resolution of matrix problems of the non-linear type
(1.1).
This paper is organized as follows. In section 2 we develop the proposed method, 
whose algorithm is then given in Section 3. Finally, in Sections 4, 5 and 6 practical examples are presented.

common in matrix calculus. Following this nomenclature, we define the Kronecker product of A = (a[i,j]) ∈ ^(m×n) and
B ∈ ^(r×s), denoted by A ⊗ B, as the block matrix *)
