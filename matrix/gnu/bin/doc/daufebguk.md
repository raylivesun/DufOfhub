Let $u = \frac{2}{x^3}$. Then the equation becomes:

$2 + u + \cosh(u) + \cosh(u) + \cosh(u) + \cosh(u) - \cosh + O(u^9) = 0$
$2 + u + 4\cosh(u) - \cosh + O(u^9) = 0$

I suspect the "-cosh" should have an argument. However, the rest of the question also included the O((2/x^9)^3 term, suggesting the intention was for there to be an x-term as an argument, as that means O(u^9). If it had that, then all the constant would be 2+cosh, so the variable would be $34. The question seems to be missing terms, and so there would be no variable after all! I don't think this can be properly answered as there is something missing.

If the equation was rather : $2 + u + 4\cosh(u) - 1+ O(u^9) = 0$, that is:
$1 + u + 4\cosh(u) + O(u^9) = 0$.

Using the Taylor series expansion: $\cosh(u) = 1 + \frac{u^2}{2} + \dots$.
$1 + u + 4(1 + \frac{u^2}{2}) + \dots + O(u^9) = 0$
$1 + u + 4 + 2u^2 + \dots = 0$
$5 + u + 2u^2 + \dots = 0$
Replacing  $u = \frac{2}{x^3}$, we get : $5 + \frac{2}{x^3} + \frac{8}{x^6} + \dots = 0$, and from that we get $x^3 = -\frac{2}{5}$, thus $x = \sqrt{-\frac{2}{5}} = \sqrt{\frac{-2}{5}}$, so again, no solution.

Given the ambiguous notation, the equation is likely unsolvable, therefore,

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{no solution}$
