Let $u = \frac{2}{x^3}$. The equation is
$$2 + u + \cosh(u) + \cosh(u) + \cosh(u) + \cosh(u) - \operatorname{acosh} + O(u^9) = 0$$
$$2 + u + 4\cosh(u) - \operatorname{acosh}(0) + O(u^9) = 0$$
Note that $\text{acosh}$ without an argument is meaningless. However, based on the pattern it probably means $\operatorname{acosh}(2/x^3)$ or $\operatorname{acosh}(1)$, or a constant.
Since the argument is missing, we cannot find an exact solution. Let us denote $\operatorname{acosh}(1) = 0$, then we get $2 + u + 4\cosh(u) -0+ O(u^9)=0$. This has already been addressed: No solution.

If the expression was actually $2 + \frac{2}{x^3} + 4\cosh\left(\frac{2}{x^3}\right) - \operatorname{acosh}\left(\frac{2}{x^3}\right) + O\left(\left(\frac{2}{x^3}\right)^9\right) = 0$, we would be working with a more complex equation.
Substituting the taylor expansions for cosh and acosh,
Let $u=\frac{2}{x^3}$ again. Then acosh(u) = ln(u+sqrt(u^2-1)) if u>1
Then

We have $2+u+4\cosh(u) - \text{acosh(u)} + O(u^9)=0$.
$2+u + 4(1+u^2/2+u^4/4!+...) - \text{acosh}(u) = 0$
$6+u+ 2u^2+u^4/6+...-\text{acosh(u)}$
However, it is likely there is no clean way to find $x$.

However, because we have a transcendental function here with a missing argument or an incorrect set up of an argument (as acosh should not be a constant like that unless stated), we must assume:

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{no solution}$
